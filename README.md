# EcoEnergyMonitor 🌱💡

**Real-time renewable energy monitoring system** built with event-driven architecture.

A production-ready backend project demonstrating scalable data pipelines, streaming, search/analytics and container orchestration – perfect for senior .NET roles in energy, IoT or big data domains.

## Features
- Simulated sensor data ingestion from renewable sources
- Apache Kafka for fault-tolerant event streaming
- Real-time data processing and enrichment
- Elasticsearch for storage and powerful aggregations (average/total energy consumption)
- Modern .NET 8 Web API with Swagger UI
- Fully containerized with Docker Compose
- Kubernetes deployment manifests ready (see `k8s/` folder)

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: C# / .NET 8
- **Streaming**: Confluent Kafka
- **Search & Analytics**: Elasticsearch 8.15
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **API Documentation**: Swashbuckle (Swagger UI)
